    "# From Mnemonic to Ethereum Account \n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will use the mnemonic, bip44, and Web3.py libraries to generate a wallet instance and a new, secure public-private key phrase from a mnemonic seed phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete each of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the following dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Import `os`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * From `dotenv` import `load_dotenv` and then call `load_dotenv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * From `bip44` import `Wallet`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * From `mnemonic` import `Mnemonic`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * From `web3` import `Account`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Remember that you don't want to generate a new mnemonic every time you run the program, because then you'll lose access to your previous mnemonic and subsequently your private key. If you have not already generated a mnemonic seed phrase and saved it to a `.env` file associated with this activity, you will need to generate one now.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have a mnemonic phrase that you would like to use for this activity, complete the following step:\n",
    "   * Create a `.env` file in the same folder as the Jupyter notebook, and set the mnemonic phrase equal to an environment variable named `MNEMONIC`. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not already have a mnemonic seed phrase that you would like to use for this activity, create one by completing the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Call `os.getenv(\"MNEMONIC\")`, and save its value as a variable named `mnemonic`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Use an `if` statement to check if the mnemonic variable is `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * If the mnemonic variable is `None`, initialize a new `Mnemonic()` instance and pass it a string value of “english” so that it will use the English word list. Save the instance as a variable named `mnemo`. Next, generate your mnemonic seed phrase by creating a variable named `mnemonic` and calling `mnemo.generate(strength=128)`. Finally, print out the mnemonic phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Create a `.env` file in the same folder as the Jupyter notebook, and create an environment variable named `MNEMONIC`. Copy the new mnemonic seed phrase that you just generated and set it equal to the `MNEMONIC` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Generate a `Wallet` instance using your `mnemonic` variable and the bip44 package.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Instantiate a new instance of the `Wallet()` class from the bip44 package, and pass it your `mnemonic` variable to create a universal wallet instance. Save the wallet instance to a variable named `wallet`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Derive public and private keys from your `wallet` instance. To do so, complete the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Create two variables, `public` and `private`, and set their values by calling the `derive_account` method on your wallet instance. In order to associate the account with Ethereum, pass the string “eth” to the `derive_account` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Create a new variable named `account`, and construct the Ethereum account by calling `Account.privateKeyToAccount` and passing it your private key variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Call `account.address` to access the address associated with your new Ethereum account. By using this address, other participants can send you ether on the Ethereum blockchain.\n",
